                    <h1>Hi Pooh!</h1>
                    <p>I just want to tell you that the only thing you need to hear right now is that it's not your fault this all happened. 
                        I never wanted to be that person who would put you in the screen right now. 
                        I know sometimes you expect certain things from me that you would have done for me. 
                        I just want to tell you that if Iâ€™m not good at it, that doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m just not familiar with the things youâ€™re used to. 
                        I know you are not doing well with all this but I want you to be at your best when you come back.
                        Thank you for being exactly who you are and for offering me a friendship I've wanted and needed in my life. ðŸ˜Š 
                    </p>
